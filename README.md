## Installation
(Instructions adopted from [blendermf](https://github.com/blendermf/XLShredLoader/blob/master/README.md#installation))

#### Mod Manager Not Installed:

*IMPORTANT NOTE 1:* If you have previously installed a modified Assembly-CSharp.dll, restore it to its orignal state before installing Unity Mod Manager.

*IMPORTANT NOTE 2:* If you have previously installed an older version of the Unity Mod Manager you will have to deinstall it and probably all of the installed mods, before installing the new Version.

*IMPORTANT NOTE 3:* Please check on the respective Mod pages what version of the Mod Manager and other Mods are required.

1. Download the latest [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wz8x8e4onjdfdbm/UnityModManager.zip?dl=1)([or from Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/)), the [Menu Mod](https://github.com/blendermf/XLShredLoader/releases/download/menu-mod-0.0.4/XLShredMenuMod-0.0.4.zip), and which ever of the [above mods](https://github.com/DanielKIWI/SkaterXL-Modding#available-mods) or [mods from blendermf's page](https://github.com/blendermf/XLShredLoader#available-mods) you like.
2. Unzip Unity Mod Manager wherever is convenient for you (it doesn't matter).
3. Open Unity Mod Manager, select Skater XL in the dropdown. At this point it may have detected your installation, if not the SkaterXL button will be red, you can click that and pick the folder manually.
4. Click the Install button. If it works it should show an installed version number. If it doesn't work check the log.
5. Go to the Mods tab, drag all the mod zips you want to install onto the box that says "Drop zip files here". If everything works the status should say ok for each of them.
6. Launch the game, have fun! Press F8 to bring up the ModMenu, and the rest is explained there.

#### Mod Manager Already Installed (watch out for required version!):

1. Download the [Menu Mod](https://github.com/blendermf/XLShredLoader/releases/download/menu-mod-0.0.4/XLShredMenuMod-0.0.4.zip), and which ever of the [above mods](https://github.com/DanielKIWI/SkaterXL-Modding#available-mods) or [mods from blendermf's page](https://github.com/blendermf/XLShredLoader#available-mods) you like.
2. Open Unity Mod Manager, go to the Mods tab, drag all the mod zips you want to install onto the box that says "Drop zip files here". If everything works the status should say ok for each of them.
3. Launch the game, have fun! Press F8 to bring up the menu, and the rest is explained there.

### Uninstalling a Mod

Right now, until I release a fix (one is coming), you have to manually remove mods to uninstall them. The process is as follows:
1. Go to your game directory (you can get this in steam, right click on the game -> properties -> local files -> browse local files)
2. Go to the Mods folder there.
3. Delete folders of the mods you want to remove from the game.
